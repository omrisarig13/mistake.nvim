**mistake.nvim** is a spelling autocorrect plugin for Neovim, based on [GitHub's *"Fixed typo"* commits](https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus) and common misspellings from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings).

## Features
- Includes over 23k entries for correction
- Lazy loads the correction dictionary in chunks with dynamic timing to reduce startup performance impact
- Includes user command for adding personal corrections
- Includes UI for editing personal corrections

## Installing (lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "https://github.com/ck-zhang/mistake.nvim",
}
```

### Configuration

If keymaps are wanted for personal corrections, the following configuration snippet can be applied:

```lua
  {
    'ck-zhang/mistake.nvim',
    config = function()
      local plugin = require 'mistake'
      vim.defer_fn(function()
        plugin.setup()
      end, 500)

      vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ma', plugin.add_entry, { desc = '[M]istake [A]dd entry' })
      vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>me', plugin.edit_entries, { desc = '[M]istake [E]dit entries' })
      vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>mc', plugin.add_entry_under_cursor, { desc = '[M]istake add [C]urrent word' })
    end,
  }
```

## Personal Corrections

To add your own corrections, use `:MistakeAdd` and `:MistakeAddCurrentWord`;
to edit your personal dictionary, use `:MistakeEdit`.

These updates will take effect immediately, no restart required.
